<body>
<p>The LDAP Classes for Java allow you to write applications to
access, manage, update, and search for information stored in 
LDAP-aware directories.</p>

<p>
The IETF LDAP Classes are based on the 
<a href="../doc/index.html" target="_blank"> Novell LDAP Classes</a>
and are limited to only those features defined in the IETF RFCs and drafts.

You should use the IETF LDAP Classes when your application requires binary
compatibility with other implementations of the Java LDAP API.
